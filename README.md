#  Aimerz Assignment-Churn Prediction using Ensemble Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn using ensemble techniques such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. It demonstrates key ML concepts like handling imbalanced data, performing feature engineering, and using boosting algorithms for better accuracy.


##  Steps Covered

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Handled missing values via imputation
- Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized churn distribution
- Compared features between churned and non-churned customers
- Analyzed feature correlations

### 3. **Handling Class Imbalance**
- Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset

### 4. **Model Building**
- Trained models using:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
- Applied cross-validation for robust performance estimation

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Score
